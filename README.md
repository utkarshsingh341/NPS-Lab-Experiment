Lab Experiments for Utkarsh Singh (1RV18CS181)


## PART - A: EXPERIMENTS  

Expt. 1. Implement a client and server communication using sockets programming. 

Expt. 2. Write a program to implement distance vector routing protocol for a simple topology of  routers.  

Expt. 3. Write a program to implement error detection and Correction concept using Checksum and  Hamming code.

Expt. 5. Write a program to implement concurrent chat server that allows current logged in users to  communicate one with other. 

Expt. 6. Implementation of concurrent and iterative echo server using both connection and  connectionless socket system calls.  

Expt. 7. Implementation of remote command execution using socket system calls.

## PART - B: EXPERIMENT

Note: The above experiments shall be conducted using C / C++ on Linux Operating System.  PART – B: SIMULATION 
1. Setup an IEEE 802.3 network with a) hub b) switch c) Hierarchy of switch. Apply theFTP, Telnet  applications between nodes. Vary the number of nodes. Vary the bandwidth,queue size and observe  the packet drop probability.  
2. Setup a wireless sensor networks with atleast two device co-coordinators and nodes.Provide  Constant Bit Rate (CBR), Variable Bit Rate (VBR) application between severalnodes. Increase the  number of co-coordinators and nodes in the same area and observe theperformance at physical and  MAC layers.  
3. Setup an IEEE 802.11 network with atleast two access points. Apply the CBR, VBRapplications  between devices belonging to same access points and different access points.Provide roaming of any  device. Vary the number of access points and devices. Find outthe delay in MAC layer, packet drop  probability.  
4. Case Study on Configuring Routers using CISCO-Packet tracer.
